    <h1>In the mood for a little reading?</h1>
    <p>The Blog area focuses on sharing how the development of this website has been progressing, documenting changes and discussing new features! This is a page managed by a single user, myself, so I am likely to use first person pronouns and ramble about opinions I come across. I might also share some cool information I find useful for other developers. I am Documenting a lot of features I make, hence I don't mind 'hippity hoppity your code is now my property' but do use the code at your own risk :)</p>
