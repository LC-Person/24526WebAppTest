        <p>Welcome to [insert name here]!</p>
        <p>Interesting introduction but not inacurate since at the time of posting this update I have not yet decided on a name to this web page project, but it does not matter right now since it is still on development. On to the important bits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> what are the plans for the website?</li>
            <li> How is this website being ran?</li>
            <li> How am I structuring the website?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What are the plans for the website?</h2>
        <p>
            The main reason I started to develop this website was to populate it as a portafolio of cool things i have done, however I also want to build it as if it was creating services and not just a 90s web page vissualy unapealing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overtime I want to implement games to the pages, building interactive games that you the user could play either alone or multiplayer localy or over the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to Implement some sort of interactive Machine learning algorithm. I am currently undecided on what kind of project i want to tackle, creating an LLM chat-bot is reasoruces intencive and everyone is also trying to build this so its kinda oversaturated. I think i might build a simulator of some sort but that is in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to build an api that allowes users to get information from hosted games and maybe one that is able to return data from the ML algorithm i build. this would require setting up databases and would mostl likely take a long time to fully implement since the projects need to be created.

            At the time of writing this article there has been a prevevious prototype website already develped. In this previous version I used the web page <a href="https://render.com">render.com</a>, this page allowes you to upload a github repositiory that contains node.js code to render a node-app online. The render page is a good way to test how the server in runs production before spending reasorces alocating a dedicated machine to host the page. The old page should not be accessible by the time you are reading this but here is a quick snapshot of the old page!

        <p>
            To keep track of version changes I use my personal github account to create a repository in which I am able to upload changes and updates for the pages. Using github has been a greate experiance more so given that I can directly push changes and simply request an update on the render dashboard.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am using node.js to handle requests by the user. I thought that using something different like wordpress or a webpage editor like wix, it would be too easy and somewhat restrictive since i would not be able to have full control. coding something with multiple purpucess would be a nightmare to navigate and eddit code. I am not using any special frameworks like angular nor handlebars, the reasoning is that I what to see what i can get away with using the bare minimum components.
        </p>

        <p>In summary: render.com + github.com + node.js + html + css = [insert name here]</p>
